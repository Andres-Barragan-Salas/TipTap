# Project 1 - *TipTap*

**TipTap** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Andres Barragan**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Gives the user the amount to pay individually for a whole party (up to a group of 6)

## Notes

Starting to use XCode for the first time was a challenge itself, even more considering the use of an updated version from the one being used in the videos. Another challenge I faced was dealing with the display size/ratio of the simulator, as it differed from the one shown in the development display. Finally, using and understandint the controller lifecycle was difficult at the beginning but quite usefull once understanded.
